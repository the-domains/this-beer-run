When I was performing a comedy show, I got a call to do a show for WhiteWater Brewing in Foresters Falls.

I sat down with the owner and found out he was a high school teacher who left a well paying job, with a great financial futre ahead of him to open a brewery, and make beer.

Why would anyone every do that?! I asked him.

I love what I do now.  It's my passion.

This Beer Run is a documentary show about all the small craft breweries, and the brewmasters who changed their lives to pursue their passion..

Making Great Beer and Sharing it with the world!
